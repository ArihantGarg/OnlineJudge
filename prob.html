    <h2>Wrong Subtraction</h2>
    <p>Little girl Tanya is learning how to decrease a number by one, but she does it wrong with a number consisting of two or more digits. Tanya subtracts one from a number by the following algorithm:

        if the last digit of the number is non-zero, she decreases the number by one;
        if the last digit of the number is zero, she divides the number by 10 (i.e. removes the last digit).
        You are given an integer number n
        . Tanya will subtract one from it k
         times. Your task is to print the result after all k
         subtractions.
        
        It is guaranteed that the result will be positive integer number.</p>
        
        <h3>Input</h3>
        <p>The first line of the input contains two integer numbers n
         and k
         (2≤n≤10<sup>9</sup>
        , 1≤k≤50
        ) — the number from which Tanya will subtract and the number of subtractions correspondingly.</p>
        
        <h3>Output</h3>
        <p>Print one integer number — the result of the decreasing n
         by one k
         times.
        
        It is guaranteed that the result will be positive integer n. </p>
